        <p>What's the meaning of this. It's information about the future isn't it. I warned you about this kid. The consequences could be disastrous. I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Not a word, not a word, not a word now. Quiet, uh, donations, you want me to make a donation to the coast guard youth auxiliary?</p>
        <p>Hi, it's really a pleasure to meet you. Whoa, whoa, kid, kid, stop, stop, stop, stop. Uh, well, actually, I figured since it wasn't due till Monday- Are you sure about this storm? It's my dad. Quiet. Pretty Mediocre photographic fakery, they cut off your brother's hair.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Perfect, just perfect. C'mon, c'mon let's go. Well, aren't you going up to the lake tonight, you've been planning it for two weeks. You extol me with a lot of confidence, Doc.</p>
        <p>Nothing. Where's Einstein, is he with you? My equipment, that reminds me, Marty, you better not hook up to the amplifier. There's a slight possibility for overload. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line.</p>
        <p>Thanks a lot, kid. Oh Mom, there's nothing wrong with calling a boy. Oh, I sure like her, Marty, she is such a sweet girl. Isn't tonight the night of the big date? Where does he come from? Dammit, Doc, why did you have to tear up that letter? If only I had more time. Wait a minute, I got all the time I want I got a time machine, I'll just go back and warn him.</p>
        <p>Sam, here's the young man you hit with your car out there. He's alright, thank god. David, watch your mouth. You come here and kiss your mother before you go, come here. Hey, Doc, we better back up, we don't have enough roads to get up to 88. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity- Yeah.</p>
        <p>That's right, he's gonna be mayor. One point twenty-one gigawatts. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Great Scott. What's a rerun? Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago. That's a big bruise you have there.</p>
