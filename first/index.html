        <p>Sam, quit fiddling with that thing and come in here and eat your dinner. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity that I need. Oh. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower. Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock. Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since. We at the Hill Valley Preservation Society think it should be preserved exactly the way it is as part of our history and heritage. Nothing's coming to my mind. What a nightmare. Yeah Mom, we know, you've told us this story a million times. You felt sorry for him so you decided to go with him to The Fish Under The Sea Dance. That's good advice, Marty. He's alright. No no no this sucker's electrical, but I need a nuclear reaction to generate the one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity-</p>
